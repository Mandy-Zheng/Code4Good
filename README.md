```


# Geopy

Geopy is a Python library that provides easy access to geographical information. It allows you to perform geocoding (finding the coordinates of addresses) and distance calculations. For this matching algorithm, we use it to calculate the distance (in miles) between zip codes based on their latitudes and longtidues.

## Installation

To use Geopy in your Python project, follow these steps to install the required packages.

1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can download them from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
